# Introduction

This is _Inform 7 Mechanics,_ a free e-book that provides a technical perspective to using Inform 7, a language and toolkit for creating interactive text-based games. 

There are two canonical resources for Inform 7 which are accessible from its website: [_Writing with Inform_](http://inform7.com/book/WI_1_1.html) __and [_The Inform Recipe Book_](http://inform7.com/book/RB_1_1.html). Both are a delight to read. As each topic is expertly explained, one feels as though one is floating down a river on a gondola tour through the magical lands of Inform, with its creator, Graham Nelson, as the skipper. The writing is curiously entertaining — slightly posh, somewhat cheeky — and there are an inordinate amount of examples at various skill levels to draw and learn from. It is truly impressive that Nelson has not only created an entire toolkit for building games that fully rests on an ancient art form — writing — but also manages, in describing and detailing the underpinnings of the Inform system itself, to remind readers of the power of that art form — and thus establish a culture for the Inform community as a whole — by modeling serious, high quality writing. For lovers of literature and linguistics, Inform is surely a masterpiece.

demonstrates this power in describing the underpinnings of the system itself. For lovers of literature and linguistics, Inform is surely a masterpiece.

It is not easy to write as many words as Nelson has written about a whole language and toolkit that is clearly his pride and joy and which he continues to improve upon to this day, and he has largely succeeded in painting a thorough picture of the many capabilities of his creation.

 The writing comes across as slightly posh, somewhat cheeky air — not a surprise, as they were both authored by the creator of Inform, Graham Nelson, a former poet and professor at Oxford. 

with plenty of help from Emily Short and Andrew Plotkin, key figures in the interactive fiction community themselves, they exhibit a friendliness

Not to say that the Inform documentation is perfect. On the contrary, while it earns points for being friendly and gentle for the absolute beginner, it slowly loses its charm as one begins to use Inform to create a project. This is particularly the case if one comes from a traditional programming background, where using natural language to build software is extremely rare. In fact, anyone who has used a computer language that claims to be "expressive" — a fancy way of saying that you can write code that reads like English — knows to be wary of the inherent limitations of such a feature. Unless the computer you're using is sentient in some manner, it is impossible to fully rely on English as a computer language. Computer languages look as contrived and stilted as they do because they _must_ be in order to provide humans an interface through which they can reliably instruct computers to accomplish tasks with predictable results. 

there are problems with using natural language as code which even Graham Nelson admits
